I left my job this week. I had been there for about a year, and I hated it. It was hard for me to explain *why* I hated this job. It was a respectable position at a recognized institution, with a moderate wage, and provided benefits like healthcare and a 401k. But it involved a long commute and days spent mostly doing nothing. I didn't have enough work, I was isolated from my coworkers, and I had no relationship or support from my manager. I would leave home at 7 am and return at 6 pm feeling exhausted and depressed from doing... well, nothing. The contents of the job itself, when I was doing them, were just okay.

I recently read *Bullshit Jobs* by David Graeber, and it helped me voice that thing that I hated so much about this job.

> Could there be anything more demoralizing than having to wake up in the morning five out of seven days of one's adult life to perform a task that one secretly believed did not need to be performed--that was simply a waste of time or resources, or that even made the world worse?

> In a truly bullshit job, it's often entirely unclear what one is really supposed to be doing, what one can say about what one is and isn't doing, who one can ask and what one can ask them, how much and within what parameters one is expected to pretend to be working, and what sort of things it is or is not permissable to do instead. This is a miserable situation. The effects on health and self-esteem are often devastating. Creativity and imagination crumble. 

Every day I went to that job I was expending mental and emotional energy trying to figure out what in the world I was supposed to be doing with my time. I felt guilt, shame, confusion, frustration, and hopelessness on a regular basis. It was a 'good job' so I should appreciate it, I didn't have anything to do so it was easy and I couldn't rightfully complain to anyone about it. I felt like I was going to be reprimanded for not working despite the fact that no one had given me any work to do (when I first started the job, I asked multiple times for more responsibilities but none were forthcoming). I soon gave up and then came to resent the times that I did have work to do. It was a "miserable situation." Ultimately, I realized I would be happier unemployed rahter than continuing to force myself to waste my time at a job I despised.

> When and how did we come to believe that creativity was supposed to be painful, or, how did we ever come up with the notion that it would be possible to sell one's time?

This book also gave me some insight into my creative work. I am trying to re-learn what work is, and think of it not just as what I'm paid for. Work is simply the things that I do. My job is what I get paid for. Why is it then that the things I do everyday, happily, willingly, can't also be the things that I'm paid for? Graeber suggests that culturally we treat paid work as "a value in itself."

> There seems a broad consensus not so much even that work is good but that *not* working is very bad; that anyone who is not slaving away harder than he'd like at something he doesn't especially enjoy is a bad person, a scrounger, a skiver, a contemptible parasite unworthy of sympathy or public relief. This feeling is echoed as much in the liberal politician's protest against the sufferings of "hardworking people" (what about those wo work only with moderate intensity?) as it is in conservative protests about skivers and "welfare queens."

If one isn't seen to be working hard at something they do not enjoy, they are probably lazy or don't deserve to be paid. Therefore, if you enjoy something, or are willing to do it for free anyway, can you really expect to be paid for it?

> If the value of work is in part the fact that it's "something we'd rather not be doing," it stands to reason that anything we would wish to be doing is less like work and more like play, or a hobby, or something we might consider doing in our spare time, and therefore less deserving of material reward. Probably we shouldn't be paid for it at all.

This is, of course, absurd. But I realize that I have been treating my creative work this way. Many artists feel ashamed to ask for any money for their work, and those same artists probably have stories of people complaining about the prices of their work, or asking them for work for free. I'm not sure what to do with this realization but I'm certain that it will help me realize some balance or peace with my work and my job (when I have a job again).

> How profoundly upsetting it was to live in a state of utter purposelessness.

> Pointlessness compounds stress.

> There are a million ways to make a human feel unworthy. The United States, so often a pioneer in such areas, has, among other things, perfected the quintessentially American mode of political discourse that consists in lecturing others about what jerks they are to think they have a right to something.
